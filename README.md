# MinesweeperAI
Created an artificial intelligence system in Python that plays minesweeper by deducing logical moves and statements through a knowledge base. Used PyGame library to visually show the AI performing its moves, whilst printing out its logical decisions and knowledge on the local machine's terminal.

Here is a short description:

With the help of a knowledge base, the AI decides which tiles are safe to move, and which tiles have a mine in them (it makes a set of logical decisions with the help of the knowledge base). If the AI does not have any data entries in the Knowledge base. then it just takes a random move on the games tiles. With the help of the PyGame library, I had implemented a user interface, so that the AI can visually show all the moves, while printing out the decisions on the AI local machine's terminal.
